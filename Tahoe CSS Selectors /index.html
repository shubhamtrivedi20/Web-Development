		        <h1>Let's Go Exploring!</h1>
		        <p>Come to Tahoe. You won't believe your eyes.</p>
		        <p>"...at last the Lake burst upon us—a noble sheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea, and walled in by a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three thousand feet higher still!...As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly photographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely be the fairest picture the whole earth affords."</p>

				<h2>Take a hike!</h2>
				<p>Hundreds of miles of scenic hiking trails.</p>
				<p>Lake Tahoe hiking trails range from easy strolls to steep switchbacks leading into the upper atmosphere. Whether you’re looking for the secluded Sierra Forest and Meadows outide Tahoe City or the waterfalls, volcanic rock and wildflowers of the Pacific Crest Trail, you’ll find the best hikes of your life in Lake Tahoe.</p>
				<p>Hiking and exploring trails on foot is one of the best ways to access the untouched beauty of Lake Tahoe, but if you prefer biking, The Flume Trail of the east shore is one of Mountain Biking Magazine's Top 10 Trails in the U.S. There are also many paved off-road bicycle paths that meander through communities on all sides of the lake.</p>
